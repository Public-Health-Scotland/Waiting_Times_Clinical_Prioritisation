<p>In November 2020, the Scottish Government introduced a new Clinical Framework called 'Coronavirus (COVID-19): supporting elective care - clinical prioritisation framework'. This was as an interim measure to 'provide NHSScotland with clear guidance for prioritising elective care whilst ensuring appropriate COVID-19 safety and priority measures were in place'. This was at a time when elective care capacity was severely constrained by the pandemic and the backlog of patients requiring treatment was beginning to grow. The Framework became no longer applicable on 22 July 2022 when it was stood down by the Scottish Government, in order to give Boards and clinicians full flexibility to manage waiting lists with a focus on eliminating long waits as well as continuing to treat the most clinically urgent patients.</p>
<p>Whilst in operation, the Framework included guidance on how patients waiting for surgery should be prioritised, the aim being to encourage a consistent approach across services. This included the adoption of a categorisation of patients based on that used in guidance developed by the <b>Federation of Surgical Specialty Associations</b> (FSSA).  This categorisation is shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Clinical prioritisation category</th>
    <th>Timescale for treatment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority level 1a emergency</td>
    <td>operation needed within 24 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority level 1b urgent</td>
    <td>operation needed within 72 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 2 surgery</td>
    <td>scheduled within 4 weeks</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 3 surgery</td>
    <td>scheduled within 12 weeks</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 4 surgery</td>
    <td>may be safely scheduled after 12 weeks</td>
  </tr>

<p>The FSSA guidance was developed at the request of NHS England in response to the 'COVID-19 crisis' and is designed to help clinicians prioritise patients waiting for specific treatments to address a particular condition. It has been revised on a regular basis throughout the period and it 'sets out what clinicians view as the relative priorities of conditions at the time' of each update. It should be emphasised that the guidance does not aim solely to dictate the category assigned to a particular patient and that a clinician may take into consideration other aspects of a patient's condition or circumstances to assign a different category from that recommended by the guidance. It should also be noted that a patient's urgency may change during their wait for treatment, say because their condition has worsened, and so a patient's categorisation may change following a clinical review.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the FSSA guidance began 'as a short term expedient to the pandemic and was not intended for long term use, however, work is ongoing on how it could make a foundation for future, national waiting list coordination as result of the magnitude of the ongoing issues with access to care'.</p>
<p>The two sets of guidance combined, the Clinical Framework and the FSSA guidance, formulated the approach that the Scottish Government wanted NHSScotland to take in the period applicable in considering the clinical classification of patients requiring surgical treatment. Following its initial introduction, PHS were commissioned to ensure national data collection could be used to understand how all patients waiting for treatment under the TTG were being categorised and to publish statistics on the data gathered, once it was of sufficient quality. </p>
<p>In response to this, local and national systems were developed and configured to capture the recording of the new clinical prioritisation categories for these patients. From July 2021, the national waiting times datamart was able to accept the new categories in records submitted and most Boards started submitting records with this information over the course of the summer of 2021. It then took some time for category recording to reach a high level of completeness due to the logistical challenges that changing local data collection presented. This included the need to categorise all patients that were already on waiting lists as well as the requirement to adjust administrative processes to ensure subsequent additions to waiting lists were categorised.</p>
<p>This dashboard provides an overview of the statistics that have been generated using the new data collected by PHS. The statistics reported span the period from July 2021 to June 2022, covering the period Boards started submitting prioritisation categories to PHS up until the latest reportable date before the framework was stepped down by Scottish Government. </p>
<p>Interpretation to support the statistics reported in this dashboard are published in the Clinical Prioritisation section of the September 2022 Inpatient, Day Case and Outpatient Stage of Treatment Waiting Times report. </p>
