<p>In November 2020, the Scottish Government introduced a new Clinical Framework called 'Coronavirus (COVID-19): supporting elective care - clinical prioritisation framework'. This was as an interim measure to 'provide NHSScotland with clear guidance for prioritising elective care whilst ensuring appropriate COVID-19 safety and priority measures were in place'. This was at a time when elective care capacity was severely constrained by the pandemic and the backlog of patients requiring treatment was beginning to grow.</p> 
<p>The Framework became no longer applicable on 22 July 2022 when it was stood down by the Scottish Government, in order to give Boards and clinicians full flexibility to manage waiting lists with a focus on eliminating long waits as well as continuing to treat the most clinically urgent patients.</p>
<p>Whilst in operation, the Framework included guidance on how patients waiting for surgery should be prioritised, the aim being to encourage a consistent approach across services. This included the adoption of a categorisation of patients based on that used in guidance developed by the 
<a href="https://fssa.org.uk/covid-19_documents.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federation of Surgical Specialty Associations (FSSA)</a>. This categorisation is shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Clinical prioritisation category</th>
    <th>Timescale for treatment</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority level 1a emergency</td>
    <td>operation needed within 24 hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Priority level 1b urgent</td>
    <td>operation needed within 72 hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 2 surgery</td>
    <td>scheduled within 4 weeks</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 3 surgery</td>
    <td>scheduled within 12 weeks</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Priority level 4 surgery</td>
    <td>may be safely scheduled after 12 weeks</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Following the introduction of the Framework, PHS were commissioned to ensure national data collection could be used to understand how all patients waiting for treatment under the Treatment Time Guarantee (TTG) were being categorised and to publish statistics on the data gathered, once it was of sufficient quality.</p>

<p>This dashboard provides an overview of the statistics that have been generated using the new data collected by PHS. The statistics reported span the period from July 2021 to June 2022, covering the period Boards started submitting prioritisation categories to PHS up until the latest reportable date before the framework was stepped down by Scottish Government. </p>
<p>More information on FSSA Guidelines, and interpretation of the statistics reported in this dashboard are published in the Clinical Prioritisation section of the <a href = "https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/nhs-waiting-times-stage-of-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> September 2022 Inpatient, Day Case and Outpatient Stage of Treatment Waiting Times report</a>.</p>
